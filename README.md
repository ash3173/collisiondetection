Designing a Hybrid Data Structure for In-Game Collisions (for 2D Games)
This hybrid data structure combines the advantageous properties of Quad-Tree and K-D Tree to optimize collision detection in 2D games. By incorporating Quad-Tree characteristics with the efficiency of K-D Tree searching, the design aims to enhance collision detection capabilities.

The complexity of searching and finding nearest points is significantly reduced with this hybrid approach. The provided image illustrates a Quad Tree that can be further optimized by integrating K-D Tree principles, streamlining the process of searching for nearest points.

In summary, this project proposes a solution for 2D graphics game collision detection. The hybrid data structure, leveraging the strengths of Quad-Tree and K-D Tree, offers improved time and space complexity compared to traditional grid systems, making it a more efficient choice for collision detection in the gaming environment.
